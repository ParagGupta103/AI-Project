# Medical Chatbot with Llama2 and Chainlit (In Progress)

This project demonstrates the development of a medical chatbot using open-source tools. Here's the breakdown:

* **Leveraging the Power of Llama2:** The project utilizes a pre-trained Llama2 7b chat ggml q80 model, known for its large language processing capabilities.
* **Building on Chainlit:** Chainlit, a framework specifically designed for chatbot construction on top of large language models, provides the foundation for this chatbot.
* **Tailored Question Answering:**  A custom prompt template was created to guide the chatbot in effectively answering medical-related questions using the provided knowledge base.
* **Text Processing with Langchain:** The Langchain library plays a crucial role in processing text data from the medical knowledge base and generating embeddings, which are then used for efficient information retrieval.

This project showcases expertise in building chatbots, focusing on the medical domain, utilizing open-source tools and state-of-the-art language models.
